    // --> Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the
    // problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at
    // each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

    // some Greed Algorithms:
    // 1. Insertion Sort
    // --> in this algo we insert the element at its correct position

    // 2. Selection Sort
    // --> in this algo we select the minimum element and swap it with the current

    // 3. Topological Sort
    // --> in this algo we sort the graph in such a way that for every directed edge
    // from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

    // 4. Prime's Algorithm
    // --> in this algo we find the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected

    // 5. Kruskal's Algorithm
    // --> in this algo we find the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected
