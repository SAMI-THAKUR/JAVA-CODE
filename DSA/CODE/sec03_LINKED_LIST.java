        //Linked List is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements not in contiguous memory locations
        // Linked List is a linear data structure
        // elements are stored in separate objects called nodes. Each node has two fields: data and pointer to the next node
        // the first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail
        /*

    # Operations:-

* Insertion: Adding a new node to the linked list.

-->At the beginning: The new node becomes the new head, and its next reference points to the previous head.
-->At the end: The new node is added as the last node, and its next reference is set to null.
-->At a specific position: The new node is inserted between two existing nodes by updating their references.

* Deletion: Removing a node from the linked list.

-->At the beginning: The head is updated to point to the next node, effectively removing the current head.
-->At the end: The second-to-last node's next reference is set to null, effectively removing the last node.
-->At a specific position: The references of the preceding and following nodes are updated to bypass the node being removed.

* Searching: Traversing the linked list to find a specific element.
* Retrieval: Accessing the elements of the linked list by traversing through the nodes.
* Updating: Modifying the value of a node in the linked list.
