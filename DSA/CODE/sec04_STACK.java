       # OPERATIONS ON STACK

Push:
* Adding an element to the top of the stack. The new element becomes the top, and the existing elements are pushed down.

Pop:
* Removing the element from the top of the stack.
* The element is returned and removed from the stack, and the next element becomes the new top.

Peek:
* Examining the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

isEmpty:
* Checking if the stack is empty. Returns true if the stack contains no elements, and false otherwise.

isFull:
* Checking if the stack is full. Returns true if the stack is full, and false otherwise.

StackOverflowError:
* In Java, if you attempt to push an element onto a stack that has reached
* its maximum capacity (usually due to memory constraints), a StackOverflowError is thrown.
